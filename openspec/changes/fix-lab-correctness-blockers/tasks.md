# Tasks — fix-lab-correctness-blockers

## 1. Mesh authorization principal (3.8)

- [x] 1.1 Add the `client` (or `frontend-sa`) ServiceAccount to `lab-infra/network/mesh/demo-app.yaml` and set `serviceAccountName` on the client pod.
- [x] 1.2 Make `labs/d2-network-policy.md` Part B and `authorizationpolicy.yaml` use that one principal. Principal consistency confirmed statically (`sa/client` used in `demo-app.yaml`, `authorizationpolicy.yaml`, and the lab text) and both YAMLs parse. **The live "authorized call → 200" run is BLOCKED (environment):** no `kubectl`/`kind`/`istioctl` in this environment (only `helm` is present) — re-run on a host with the cluster tooling before marking valid.

## 2. Istio istiod egress (3.9)

- [x] 2.1 Ship an `allow-egress-to-istiod` NetworkPolicy (egress to `istio-system` on `15012`) in `lab-infra/network/`.
- [x] 2.2 Teach it in the lab as opening the management-plane L4 path. YAML validated; wired into `up-mesh.sh`. **Live "sidecars get certs, STRICT mTLS succeeds" run is BLOCKED (environment)** — same missing `kubectl`/`istioctl` as 1.2.

## 3. WebAuthn secure context (3.10)

- [x] 3.1 Front Keycloak with TLS for `labs/d1-keycloak-sso-mfa.md` Part C, or port-forward to `localhost` with RP ID `localhost`, and state which in the lab.
- [ ] 3.2 Verify passkey registration and the RP-ID-mismatch exercise are reachable. **BLOCKED (environment):** requires a live Keycloak (no `kubectl`/`helm` cluster access here) plus a real browser for `navigator.credentials.create` — neither is available in this headless run. Re-run manually before marking the lab valid.

## 4. Cert-issuer lifecycle (3.11)

- [x] 4.1 Add a Phase 2 Day 6 certs bring-up block (`certs/up.sh` + re-apply the issuer chain) or retarget the ingress-WAF lab to the shipped `ca-issuer`.
- [ ] 4.2 Verify the Day 6 Certificate reaches `Ready=True`. **BLOCKED (environment):** no `kubectl`/`kind` here to actually bring up cert-manager and check `Ready=True`. The plan/lab text is now internally consistent (retargeted to the shipped `ca-issuer`/`oss500-lab-ca`); live confirmation is owed on a host with cluster tooling.

## 5. SIEM spine (3.12)

- [x] 5.1 Ship a complete `lab-infra/siem/config/ossec.conf` including `<ruleset>` so decoders/rules load.
- [x] 5.2 Add `cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]` and a crafted-log or sshd-sidecar path to the agent, with the exact expected file/line format.
- [x] 5.3 Simplify the Sigma rule to a `-p`-less keyword selection that current pySigma converts.
- [ ] 5.4 Verify one alert end-to-end (telemetry → parsed alert) before marking the lab valid. **BLOCKED (environment):** the Sigma conversion half was live-verified against current `sigma-cli`/`pysigma-backend-opensearch` (see the lab's Validation status note — this also surfaced and fixed a real `-t opensearch` → `opensearch_lucene` target-name break). The manager/indexer/agent half needs the full ~4–6 GB `docker compose -p oss500-siem` stack; this host already had a kind cluster up and only ~18 GB free disk, and the component's own README says run it completely alone, so it was not brought up here. Config files were validated as well-formed (XML/YAML) instead. Re-run on a clean host before marking the lab fully valid.

## 6. Grafana posture dashboard (3.13)

- [x] 6.1 Commit the four-panel posture dashboard as a `grafana_dashboard`-labelled ConfigMap and apply it in `lab-infra/observability/up.sh` (or reword Part D to "build these panels in Explore"). Shipped `lab-infra/observability/dashboards.yaml`, applied by `up.sh`. While building this, found and fixed two panels that weren't actually achievable as originally described: kube-state-metrics ships no "pods running as root"/securityContext metric at all (verified against the upstream docs — swapped for the real, verifiable posture proxy `kube_pod_service_account{service_account="default"}`, CIS 5.1.5), and Tempo has no native time-series query for "trace latency" (added a `spanmetrics` connector to `otel-collector.yaml` to derive a real Prometheus histogram from spans, plus the `ServiceMonitor` that was needed to scrape it — one didn't exist even though a comment claimed it did). Gave the datasources explicit `uid`s so the dashboard JSON can reference them.
- [ ] 6.2 Verify the dashboard is present after bring-up. **BLOCKED (environment):** no `kubectl`/`kind`/`helm`-cluster access here to actually run `up.sh` and check Grafana. Verified statically instead: the ConfigMap YAML parses, its embedded JSON is valid and has exactly 4 panels each pointed at a datasource uid that now exists, and the `otel-collector.yaml` config the new panel depends on parses and has a coherent connector/pipeline wiring. Live confirmation on a host with the cluster tooling is still owed.

## 7. Validation

- [x] 7.1 Run `openspec validate fix-lab-correctness-blockers --type change --strict`. Passes: "Change 'fix-lab-correctness-blockers' is valid". `npm run lint:links` also passes.
